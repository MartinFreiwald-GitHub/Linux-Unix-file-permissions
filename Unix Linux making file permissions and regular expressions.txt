To make this file permission with chmod below.

chmod 754 install.sh
or
chmod a+rwx,g-w,o-wx install.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-rw-r--r--  Means, “sets permissions so that, (U)ser / owner can read, can write and can’t execute.  (G)roup can read, can’t write and can’t execute.  (O)thers can read, can’t write and can’t execute” (Web Article, https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-644/).

The D to start means Directory Access Modes.  Explained here.  
“Directory Access Modes
Directory access modes are listed and organized in the same manner as any other file.  There are a few differences that need to be mentioned.
READ 
Access to a directory means that the use can read the contents.  The user can look at the filenames inside the directory.
WRITE
Acess means that the user can add or delete files from the directory.
EXECUTE 
Executing a directory doen’t really make sense, so think of this as a traverse permission.  A user must have execute access to the bin directory in order to execute the ls or the cd command” (Web Article, https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm).

-rwsr-sr-x  Means, “sets permissions so that, (U)ser / owner can read, can write and can execute.  (G)roup can read, can’t write and can execute.  (O)thers can read, can’t write and can execute”(Web Article, https://chmodcommand.com/chmod-6755/).

Chmod 6755 httpd
Or 
Chmod a+rwx,g-w,o-w,ug+s,+t,-t httpd
